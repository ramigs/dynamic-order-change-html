# How to dynamically change the order of HTML elements

Let's say you're working on a page that has two main components - **Element A** and
**Element B**.

Suppose you had to implement a responsive layout with the following
requirements:

1. Desktop: **Element A** should be positioned on top of **Element B**
1. Mobile: **Element B** should be positioned on top of **Element A**

This repo contains the code I used to create a tutorial with two different
approaches to solve these requirements.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve at localhost:5000
npm run dev
```
